# Forbidden-Island
An adaptation of the board game made during studies

This project was made during our course of Java programming, UML conception and UI creation. The whole conception had to be made during 4 weeks while we had our studies and a part of the java code was made during this iteration. The rest of the code was made during one week.

A french version of the conception is available as PDF format.
